                        In the north of the island of Palawan, southwest of the Philippines,
                        the ordinary aspect of the city of El Nido highlights the contrast between the mundane
                        and the sublime. El Nido, a small village north of Palawan, Philippines, is one of the
                        most popular tourist destinations in the world at the moment.

                        Palawan Island is located in the southwestern part of the Philippines archipelago, and is
                        one of the most popular islands for tourists and expatriates because of its very
                        pleasant climate (the island is sheltered from typhoons) and the fact that its
                        population is very welcoming, making its visit safe.

                        Anse Source d'Argent beach is considered one of the most beautiful beaches in the world, and
                        with good reason. Its turquoise waters, white sand and impressive rocks formed by the action of
                        water and wind.

                        The route to the beautiful Anse Source d'Argent beach is made through an old coconut and vanilla
                        plantation where it is still possible to see the old coconut mills. In addition, it is possible
                        to visit its peculiar inhabitants, the giant tortoises.

                        Dusk is one of the best times to visit Anse Source d'Argent beach, as it is when the colors are
                        more intense and the photos take on an almost unreal aspect.

                        Finding beaches in the Caribbean is easy. Finding beaches that are accessible, clean and family
                        friendly, is a bit of a more difficult task. The best beaches in Jamaica can be found in places
                        like Ocho Rios, Montego Bay, and Negril. Among the most beautiful beaches, Seven Mile Beach in
                        Negril, Jamaica is the shining star.

                        Powdery white sand, crystal clear water and loads of watersports set the tone for an experience
                        at Seven Mile Beach which has skyrocketed in popularity over the years. The beach is near Norman
                        Manley Boulevard in Negril, which is a relatively small town with a population of just over
                        3,000 people. Considered a legendary beach for experienced beach hoppers, Seven Mile Beach
                        consists of a long four-mile stretch, while the other three miles extends into Bloody Bay.

                    <p>As tourism grows in the region, the city develops more. However, despite this development, Tulum
                        still preserves the simple, rustic and roots characteristics that were responsible for its
                        popularity.</p>
                    <p>In addition, there is all the concern with sustainable development, which is precisely what makes
                        Tulum a special place, very different from the style of Cancun, its large buildings and
                        all-inclusive resorts.</p>
                    <p>I would define Tulum as a “rustic-chic” place in tune with the environment… The simple place
                        blends in with chic restaurants and hotels that approach a different concept of luxury. Tulum's
                        hotel zone doesn't have grandiose buildings, but they are very beautiful, with a peculiar
                        architecture that catches the eye and makes you want to take lots of pictures, because every
                        corner has its charm.</p>

                        Nassau is the capital and largest city in the Bahamas, with approximately 250,000 inhabitants. Just look at how important Nassau is… The Bahamas as a whole has just 400,000 inhabitants! It is located in New Providence, one of the more than 700 islands that make up the country.

                    <p>
                        Nassau was founded by the British in the 17th century. It became a “pirate republic” for years. Even the famous Blackbeard has settled there! Then the British regained power.

                    <p>
                        Since 1973 the Bahamas has been an independent country, but is part of the Commonwealth. They have a prime minister and their queen is Elisabeth II.
