# Travel Website
Choose some available destinations for your next trip, read their description and get in touch if you are interested in purchasing.

## Description
The website was made using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The intention is that the user can have a good experience with the page, through its functionalities.
At first, I made available 6 different destinations arranged in a carousel, allowing the user to see every 3 images and, when hovering the mouse over them, display the name of the destination. If they click on them, the user is redirected to the services page, where they are provided with details about the places offered and where they have the option to purchase. When clicking on the purchase button or on the image of the destination, the contact page is loaded so that the mandatory data can be filled in. Therefore, the team will have all the data to contact the desired person.
